# Redux Workshop

## Overview
Hey, Welcome to my small Redux Workshop!

I start to build a Todo App but unfortunatly I can't achieve it, so you will have to finish my app.

Before you start here are some of the functionnality allready implemented and other wich are not : 
* Redux store >> The store is already setup, you should not need to modify this file
* todoSlice.ts >> Unfortunatly I didn't achieve to work on this file, as you will see there is already some functionnal reducers, but some are just commented as reminder to build them, **it will be your first mission!** Luckily you can use the ones I build as exemple
* TodoDisplayer.tsx >> This component works well, I recommand you to use the ReduxDevTool in your browser to visualize what happend when you select a Todo
* Todo.tsx >> This component works well but it will be amazing if you can add a button to delete the Todo, **this will be your second mission!**
* AddTodo.tsx >> I build all the component but you have to finish the handleSubmit function to update the store by adding a new todo and close the modal. **It will be your third mission !**
* EditTodo.tsx >> Well actually pretty much the same than the previous one, but check the Payload format to avoid error ! **It will be your last mission !**
